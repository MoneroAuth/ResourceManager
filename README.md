MoneroAuth Resource Manager, a.k.a. **The Gatekeeper** is the entity responsible for authenticating and authorizing entities to access resources under its control.

A Resource Manager has its own digital ID and authbot. It responds to commands in private rooms sent via end-to-end encrypted messaging.

A Resource Manager maintains a database of Resources (and Resource actions) as well as an authorization dataset which specifies what IDs have access to specified Resource actions.
